This is the javaScript code for the Google Apps script that I made which allows a Google Form (which I created) to publish to a Google Calendar. Date and time had to be carefully parsed from user input (see utilityFunctions.js), which on the form was geared towards the easiest user interaction (and time options needed to be limited).

The js files need to be copy/pasted into the Google Apps script editor of the Google Sheet that receives the Google Form output. The js files are posted to my github for a record, and for a public reference on how to build this kind of app in the google apps script environment.

Google apps script hoists all the function declarations in the separate js files and makes them all available to each other,
but if you wanted to put them all in one app.js file ordered according to a logical flow of dependency, 
the utility functions would go first, then the createEvent function, and lastly the onSubmit function.
